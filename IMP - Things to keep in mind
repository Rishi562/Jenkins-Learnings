IMPORTANT - the jenkins server will not connect with tomcat while uploading artifact to deploytotest tomcat server 
unless we make changes to tomcat-users.xml
located at cd /etc/tomcat9
use this - 
<role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>


Building end to end pipeline - refer to 36 and 37

Slave - 

While creating credentials for slave
disable "Know hosts file verification strategy" by setting "Non verifying Verification Strategy", but it is insecure.
This will connect directly and will not give a hostkey headache

root directory - /var/jenkins  - we can give anypath, we will furhter need to create /jenkins folder
further, make the owner of this folder to the user which will be setup in credentials
if username is ubuntu ,
then sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu jenkins/
but it should exist in the jenkins slave
