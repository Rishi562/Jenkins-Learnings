As we have configured the slave node previously
as 
usage - use this  node as much as possible

so any new build we perform will run on these nodes
But,it does not mean that priority will be given to this node,
use as much means it will try to use this node as much as possible 
but not assign all jobs to slave first

if we run multiple jobs any job can run anywhere.

to configure the jobs to run on master or slave
goto the job/configure and in general select restrict job
put the label for the job
now the job will run only on slave/master

The output will be displayed on master only of all slave output
