there can be issues while executing outr build,

for example - Jenkins server is not responding
internet connectivity issues
wrong git URL

We can then force it to rerty the job 3 stime before failing
earlier,the job used to fail on the 1st time, but now it tries to 
execute 3 times before failing

There is 10 second dalay before each rerty
