spin 2 ubuntu machines on aws,
install and configure tomcat9 on both
IMPORTANT - the jenkins server will not connect with tomcat while uploading artifact to deploytotest tomcat server 
unless we make changes to tomcat-users.xml
located at cd /etc/tomcat9
use this - 
<role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>


Install a Maven integration and deploy to container and build pipeline Plugin first into Jenkins 


Goto Global tool config and add maven 
let it be install automatically


create a maven project from new item.
in the build - goals, put - test. this will translate as mvn test

after below is created, add a post build action to run the build project

now create a build project for the same,in build , put install. this will create a build for the project
make sure to add source code as git in both and put this https://github.com/Rishi562/spring-boot-war-example.git
branch to build */master - this is in git

When this build will run this will create a .war file which will be displayed by Jenkins
Before that,make changes in build project - 
post build - archive to artifact
files to archive - put - **/*.war
Now set downstream as Deploytotest ptoject
goals and options - install
build trigger - Build whenever a snapshot depedency is built


now the created war file should be eployed to our deploytotest project and linux machine
to pickup this war file/archive/artifact, install plugin - copy artifact       --- "archive" specifically relates to the action of preserving files in a Jenkins 
                                                                                    job's workspace after a build, whereas "artifact" refers to the build outputs 
                                                                                    that are intended to be shared or used beyond the build process
                                                                                    The terms are closely related, and in many cases, archiving is used as a way to create
                                                                                    artifacts for distribution or reference.
                          
to do this , go back to build project,configure and make changes,allow to copy artifacts.
Then specify the projects who can copy

Step - 3 

make changes into deploytotest.
build step - copy artifact from other project
also put pws and ls after this to see where it is stored
generally - jenkins/workspace

Post build action in same deploytotest - archive the artifacts
**/*.war
Then another post build - Deploy war/ear to container
**/*.war

Context path - /app - this means we can access it as -ipaddress/app

Containers - 
give username and password of tomcat server and add tomcat9details as ID
now give the url of server - http://13.127.103.87:8080
move deploy other project earlier configured to last by dragging it

IMPORTANT - the jenkins server will not connect with tomcat while uploading artifact to deploytotest tomcat server 
unless we make changes to tomcat-users.xml
located at cd /etc/tomcat9
use this - 
<role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>


STEP - 4 
Now configure deploytoProd machine

add build steps - 
copy artifact 

add post build - 
deploy to container
**/*.war
context path -/app
select tomcat9 and app production url - http://3.6.38.174:8080

we need to make the tomcat-users.xml changes on prod server also
also remember to visit the tomcat server and sign in 1st and cancel the sign in

Remember to give permission in deploytotest to allow copying of artifacts


If we make commit changes into github,the test pipeline will now run because 
jenkins is setup to see if there are changes every 2 minutes.
we can use webhook , here we are using poll scm as we are running jenkins locally and
it does not have a public IP yet

so the pipeline is now testing,building,deploying to test server automatically

we can aslo setup that changes are pushed to build if test case passes more than 90%
only after this the build of artifact will happen
