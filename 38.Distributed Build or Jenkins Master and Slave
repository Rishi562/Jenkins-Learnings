currently we can run only 2 jobs
as we can see in build executor systemctl

goto manage/configure change no. of executor to change this

But in real life,there are around 50 projects jobs running
so we can get memory error

due to this,we have jenkins master slave

make 1 master and other slaves
it is the job of the master to distribute the project jobs
and on which machine will it be built

it aslo determines slave node status,running or down
the output is given back to master to show to the user

along with,master can also run jobs with slaves

Slaves - 
1.listens to requests from master
2.perform the task
3.slave can run on variety of OS -win/linux/docker/machine


How to add a slave node - 

Mange/manage nodes
click new node - name it anythinng
choose permanent agent
add discription and name it
define no. of executors

root directory - /var/jenkins  - we can give anypath, we will furhter need to create /jenkins folder
further, make the owner of this folder to the user which will be setup in credentials
if username is ubuntu ,
then sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu jenkins/
but it should exist in the jenkins slave
add labels
usage default

make sure your linux machine has java installed

launch method -  ass ssh creds and password
use a verification stratergy ---------------------------------disable "Know hosts file verification strategy" by setting "Non verifying Verification Strategy", but it is insecure.
                                                               This will connect directly and will not give a hostkey headache
default availability
save it

now we have added a slave with 2 executors , voila!
