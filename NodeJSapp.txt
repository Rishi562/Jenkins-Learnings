Why Node JS ?

opensource
crossplatform
used to execute server side
has an event driven architecture
capable of asynchronous I/O 
    this maskes nodejs very fast to responding to requests



handy to run small projects as they do not need to compile


How to build NodeJS app ?
1. install dependencies(npm install)
    this downloads and installs dependencies

2. Run tests(npm test)
    runs all node js tests
    if test fails,dev should be notified

3.Package it(but how ?)
    package it in docker
    create a container all binaries and libraries needed

4.Distribute
    distribute docker image using docker registry
    dockerhub,AWS container registry
