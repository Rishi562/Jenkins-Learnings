check the box "trigger build remotely" in build triggers

select a name for your token.
now copy and paste http://jenkins.local:8080//job/demo%205/build?token=mytokenforjenkins
to run your build remotely.

This will perform a build remotely for you




if we want to run this from another browser or shell,
it will as for ID and password for my jenkins

ex - 
curl http://jenkins.local:8080//job/demo%205/build?token=mytokenforjenkins

this is invalid.

To solve this - 
We install a plugin - Build Authourization Token Root

and we use the URL - http://jenkins.local:8080/buildByToken/build?job=demo%205&token=mytokenforjenkins

This can be executed from anywhere

To run this is terminal we all \before & as this sends it to the background

http://jenkins.local:8080/job/demo%205/
