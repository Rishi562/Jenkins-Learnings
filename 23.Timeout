for example, we have a sleep timer in our shell script 
sleep 240 - sleeps for 4 minutes

or if a job is stuck,
the build will fail if if exceeds this time interval.

This helps us to come out of the code if the job is stuck

we can set this up in Build Environment section of the project

So,we can either abort the job or fail the job
