Jenkins is an open source CI CD tool written in Java

It is an automation server used to build and deliver software projects
benefit - lots of plugins


What is CICD ?
CI is a practice in soft Engg , of merging all developer working
copies to a shared mainline, several times a day

CD is a soft wngg approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.


So,it means veryfing and publishing work by trigging automated builds and tests
these automations can be done for every commit or at specific times of the day

all work should be pushed to a version control which should 
then be built and tested - this can be done by Jenkins


Jenkins does not merge code or resolve conflicts.it can do the automated build the test.



Jenkins provides a feedback loop back to the developor to fix build errors

so this reduces the iteration of SDLC



Part 2

SDLC -
1.Dev write code --> 2.build                          --->3. Test                                       -->4. Release                                                                      -->5. provision servers
                  Feature & master branch               Diff types of test                              Packaging of software to release it                                              Deploy our package on linux or win servers where customer can now use it
                  compile                               Aagin dev is notified if there are error        can  be packaged in archive or vm or zip or container depends on project
                  if jenkins detects a build fail,
                  it sends back to dev
                   


build test and release can be done via jenkins
we can also build and test on jenkins and release with diff tool
or we can use jenkins for whole SDLC
