If a job has an upstream ,if we have a demo 7,and it has an upstream demo 5, it means demo 7 will be built automatically when demo 5 is built

demo 5 is the upstream of demo 7


we can have multiple projects set ups as upstream of 7.
we can fail demo 6 which is upstream of 7 but still the 7 will built because we have set up build triggers in demo 7 that way


To make a job unstable,we can put exit 10 in the execute shell of the job.
Here we are making project 5 unstable
