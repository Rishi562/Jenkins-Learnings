Upstream is the parent job
Downstream is the child job

the job which gets triggered is the child
and the job which triggers it is the parent


we can turn on option in child in general/advanced
block build when upstream is building
so,even if someone triggers the child manually,it does not work 

Similarly,
we can turn on option in parent in general/advanced
block build when upstream is building
so,even if someone triggers the parent manually,it does not work
